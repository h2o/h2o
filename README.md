H2O - an optimized HTTP server / library implementation
===

H2O is an optimized HTTP server implementation that can be used either as a standalone server or a library.

Supported Protocols
---

- HTTP/1.0 (http and https)
- HTTP/1.1 (http and https)
- Websocket (RFC6455, both ws and wss)
- HTTP/2.0 (draft 14, via Upgrade, NPN, ALPN)

Dependencies
---

- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (mandatory)
- [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) (optional; required when building the server)
- [libuv 1.0.0](https://github.com/joyent/libuv) (optional; required when using h2o as a library)
- [wslay](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/wslay) (optional; required if you need support for websocket)

Benchmark
---

Written from the ground up, H2O outperforms nginx by more than 2x.  The table below is a comparison of request-per-seconds taken using `ab -c 500 -n 100000 -k` on Ubuntu 14.04 running on VMWare Fusion.

|Server \ size of content|6 bytes|4,096 bytes|
|------------------------|------:|----------:|
|nginx/1.7.4 ([conf](https://gist.github.com/kazuho/c9c12021567e3ab83809))            | 35,822|     32,885|
|H2O @ 6085457           | 76,690|     67,866|

Building and Running the Server
---

Run the commands below to build and run the H2O server.  The last command will read the configuration from [examples/h2o.conf](https://github.com/kazuho/h2o/blob/master/examples/h2o.conf) and start listening on port 8080.  Try accessing [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cmake .
$ make h2o
$ ./h2o -c examples/h2o.conf
```

Building the Library
---

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cmake .
$ make libh2o
```

The library is designed to work together with the upcoming [libuv version 1.0.0](https://github.com/joyent/libuv).  Examples can be found within the [examples/](https://github.com/kazuho/h2o/blob/master/examples/) directory.
