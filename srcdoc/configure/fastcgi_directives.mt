<p>
This document describes the configuration directives of the FastCGI handler.
</p>
<p>
The configuration directives of the FastCGI handler can be categorized into two groups.
<code>Fastcgi.connect</code> and <code>fastcgi.spawn</code> define the address (or the process) to which the requests should be sent.
Other directives customize how the connections to the FastCGI processes should be maintained.
</p>

<?
$ctx->{directive}->(
    name      => "fastcgi.connect",
     levels    => [ qw(path extension) ],
     desc      => q{The directive specifies the address at where the FastCGI daemon is running.},
)->(sub {
?>
<p>
If the argument is a mapping, following properties are recognized.
<dl>
<dt><code>host</code>
<dd>name (or IP address) of the server running the FastCGI daemon (ignored if <code>type</code> is <code>unix</code>)
<dt><code>port</code>
<dd>TCP port number or path to the unix socket
<dt><code>type</code>
<dd>either <code>tcp</code> (default) or <code>unix</code>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
If the argument is a scalar, the value is considered as a TCP port number and the host is assumed to be <code>127.0.0.1</code>.

)->(sub {

<p>
In contrast to <code>fastcgi.connect</code> that connects to a FastCGI server running externally, this directive launches a FastCGI process manager under the control of H2O, and terminates it when H2O quits.
The argument is a <code>/bin/sh -c</code> expression to be executed when H2O boots up.
The HTTP server records the process id of the expression, and sends <code>SIGTERM</code> to the id when it exits.

<p>
As of version 1.4.0, the spawned process is run under the privileges of user specified by the <a href="configure/base_directives.html#user"><code>user</code></a> directive (in version 1.3.x, the FastCGI process was spawned under the privileges that spawned the H2O standalone server).
It is possible to specify a different user for running the FastCGI process, by providing a mapping that contains an attribute named <code>user</code> together with an attribute named <code>command</code>.

<p>
In H2O, it is possible to perform internal redirects (a.k.a. delegations or URL rewrites) using <a href="configure/redirect_directives.html">the <code>redirect</code> directive</a> or <a href="configure/reproxy_directives.html">by returning <code>X-Reproxy-URL</code> headers</a> from web applications.
The directive specifies whether to send the original values to the FastCGI process (default), or if the rewritten values should be sent.
