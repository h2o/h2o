Portions of the software use following libraries that are also licensed under the MIT license: <a href="https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/deps/klib/khash.h">khash.h</a>, <a href="https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/deps/picohttpparser/">PicoHTTPParser</a>, <a href="https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/deps/yaml/">libyaml</a>.

Depending on how H2O is configured, the software links against OpenSSL or LibreSSL, both of which are <a href="https://www.openssl.org/source/license.html">dual-licensed under the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license</a>.

<h3 id="libh2o">How do I use H2O as a library?</h3>

<div>
<p>
Aside from the standalone server, H2O can also be used as a software library.
The name of the library is <code>libh2o</code>.
</p>
<p>
To build H2O as a library you will need to install the following dependencies:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> version 1.0.2 or above<?= $ctx->{note}->(q{libh2o cannot be linked against the bundled LibreSSL; see <a href="https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/290">issue #290</a>}) ?></li>
</ul>
In case the dependencies are installed under a non-standard path, <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> configuration variable can be used for specifying their paths.  For example, the following snippet builds <code>libh2o</code> using the libraries installed in their respective paths.
</p>

<?= $ctx->{code}->(<< 'EOT')
% PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/openssl-1.0.2a/lib/pkgconfig cmake .
% make libh2o
EOT
?>
