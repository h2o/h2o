The SSL Conservatory
====================

Correct implementation of SSL is crucial to secure transmission of data
between clients and servers. However, this crucial task is frequently done
improperly, due to complex APIs and lack of understanding of SSL fundamentals.

This is intended to be a clearinghouse for well-documented and secure sample
code to correctly implement SSL clients. Pull requests with examples for
other languages or frameworks are encouraged.
