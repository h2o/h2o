<p>
Proxy module is the proxy implementation for H2O - it implements a reverse HTTP proxy and a CONNECT proxy.
</p>
<p>
A reverse HTTP proxy is setup using the <a href="configure/proxy_directives.html#proxy.reverse.url"><code>proxy.reverse.url</code></a> directive.
A CONNECT proxy is setup using the <a href="configure/proxy_directives.html#proxy.reverse.url"><code>proxy.connect</code></a> directive.
</p>
<p>
When acting as a reverse HTTP proxy, following request headers are added and forwarded to the backend server:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.7.1">via</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/x-forwarded-headers.html#x-forwarded-for">x-forwarded-for</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/x-forwarded-headers.html#x-forwarded-proto">x-forwarded-proto</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
By default, all requests to the backend server are sent using HTTP/1.1.
Use of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 to backend servers is considered experimental; their use can be controlled via directives <a href="configure/proxy_directives.html#proxy.http2.ratio"><code>proxy.http2.ratio</code></a> and <a href="configure/proxy_directives.html#proxy.http3.ratio"><code>proxy.http3.ratio</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
Following sections describe the configuration directives defined for the module.

<p>
When more than one backend is declared, the load is distributed among the backends using the strategy specified by the <code>balancer</code> property.
Currently we support <code>round-robin</code> (the default) and <code>least-conn</code> as the value of the property.
The strategies are applied when establishing a new connection becomes necessary (i.e. when no pooled connections exist).
</p>
<p>
<code>weight</code> can be assigned to each backend as an integer between 1 and 256.
The default value is 1.
</p>
<p>
For the <code>round-robin</code> balancer, <code>weight</code> is respected in this way: each backend would be selected exactly <code>weight</code> times before next backend would be selected, except when the backend is not accessable.
</p>
<p>
For <code>least-conn</code> balancer, <code>weight</code> is respected in this way: the selected backend should have the minimum value of (request count) / (<code>weight</code>).
</p>
<p>
H2O will try to reconnect to different backends (in the order determined by the load balancing strategy) until it successfully establishes a connection.
It returns an error when it fails to connect to all of the backends.
</p>
<p>
In addition to TCP/IP over IPv4 and IPv6, the proxy handler can also connect to an HTTP server listening to a Unix socket.
Path to the unix socket should be surrounded by square brackets, and prefixed with <code>unix:</code> (e.g. <code>http://[unix:/path/to/socket]/path</code>).

<p>
Each element of the access control list starts with either <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> followed by an wildcard (<code>*</code>) or an IP address with an optional netmask and an optional port number.

When a CONNECT request is received and the name resolution of the connect target is complete, the access control list is searched from top to bottom.
If the first entry that contains a matching address (and optionally the port number) starts with a <code>+</code>, the request is accepted and a tunnel is established.
If the entry starts with a <code>-</code>, the request is rejected.
</p>
<p>
If none of the entries match, the request is also rejected.

Maximum size of this buffer is controlled by <code>proxy.max-buffer-size</code>.
The drawback of this approach is that it causes pressure on memory bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
This knob provides two alternative modes to remedy the pressure:
</p>
<p>
When set to <code>enabled</code>, if zerocopy operation in supported by the downstream connection (i.e., downstream connection being cleoartext or encrypted using kernel TLS), h2o uses a pipe as an internal buffer instead of using userspace memory.
Data is moved to the pipe using the <code>splice</code> system call, then shipped to the downstream connection by another call to <code>splice</code>.
Pressure to memory bandwidth is eliminated, as the <code>splice</code> system call merely moves the references to kernel memory between file descriptors.
</p>
<p>
When set to <code>always</code>, data from upstream is spliced into a pipe regardless of downstream connection providing support for zerocopy.
When the downstream connection does not support zerocopy, data is intially moved into the pipe, then gets read and written to the socket (as well as being encrypted, if necessary) as late as it becomes possible to send the data.
This approach does not reduce the total amount of bytes flowing through the CPU, but reduces the amount of userspace memory used by h2o by delaying the reads, thereby reducing cache spills.
