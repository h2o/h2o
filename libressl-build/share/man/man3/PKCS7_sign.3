PKCS7_sign \- create a PKCS#7 signedData structure

.Vb 1

\&
\& PKCS7 *PKCS7_sign(X509 *signcert, EVP_PKEY *pkey, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, BIO *data, int flags);
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIPKCS7_sign()\fR creates and returns a PKCS#7 signedData structure. \fBsigncert\fR is
the certificate to sign with, \fBpkey\fR is the corresponding private key.
\&\fBcerts\fR is an optional additional set of certificates to include in the PKCS#7
structure (for example any intermediate CAs in the chain).
.PP
The data to be signed is read from \s-1BIO \s0\fBdata\fR.
.PP
\&\fBflags\fR is an optional set of flags.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Any of the following flags (ored together) can be passed in the \fBflags\fR
parameter.
.PP
Many S/MIME clients expect the signed content to include valid \s-1MIME\s0 headers. If
the \fB\s-1PKCS7_TEXT\s0\fR flag is set \s-1MIME\s0 headers for type \fBtext/plain\fR are prepended
to the data.
.PP
If \fB\s-1PKCS7_NOCERTS\s0\fR is set the signer's certificate will not be included in the
\&\s-1PKCS7\s0 structure, the signer's certificate must still be supplied in the
\&\fBsigncert\fR parameter though. This can reduce the size of the signature if the
signers certificate can be obtained by other means: for example a previously
signed message.
.PP
The data being signed is included in the \s-1PKCS7\s0 structure, unless
\&\fB\s-1PKCS7_DETACHED\s0\fR is set in which case it is omitted. This is used for \s-1PKCS7\s0
detached signatures which are used in S/MIME plaintext signed messages for
example.
.PP
Normally the supplied content is translated into \s-1MIME\s0 canonical format (as
required by the S/MIME specifications) if \fB\s-1PKCS7_BINARY\s0\fR is set no translation
occurs. This option should be used if the supplied data is in binary format
otherwise the translation will corrupt it.
.PP
The signedData structure includes several PKCS#7 authenticatedAttributes
including the signing time, the PKCS#7 content type and the supported list of
ciphers in an SMIMECapabilities attribute. If \fB\s-1PKCS7_NOATTR\s0\fR is set then no
authenticatedAttributes will be used. If \fB\s-1PKCS7_NOSMIMECAP\s0\fR is set then just
the SMIMECapabilities are omitted.
.PP
If present the SMIMECapabilities attribute indicates support for the following
algorithms: triple \s-1DES, 128\s0 bit \s-1RC2, 64\s0 bit \s-1RC2, DES\s0 and 40 bit \s-1RC2.\s0 If any of
these algorithms is disabled then it will not be included.
.PP
If the flags \fB\s-1PKCS7_STREAM\s0\fR is set then the returned \fB\s-1PKCS7\s0\fR structure is
just initialized ready to perform the signing operation. The signing is however
\&\fBnot\fR performed and the data to be signed is not read from the \fBdata\fR
parameter. Signing is deferred until after the data has been written. In this
way data can be signed in a single pass.
.PP
If the \fB\s-1PKCS7_PARTIAL\s0\fR flag is set a partial \fB\s-1PKCS7\s0\fR structure is output to
which additional signers and capabilities can be added before finalization.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
If the flag \fB\s-1PKCS7_STREAM\s0\fR is set the returned \fB\s-1PKCS7\s0\fR structure is \fBnot\fR
complete and outputting its contents via a function that does not properly
finalize the \fB\s-1PKCS7\s0\fR structure will give unpredictable results.
.PP
Several functions including \fISMIME_write_PKCS7()\fR, \fIi2d_PKCS7_bio_stream()\fR,
\&\fIPEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream()\fR finalize the structure. Alternatively finalization
can be performed by obtaining the streaming \s-1ASN1 \s0\fB\s-1BIO\s0\fR directly using
\&\fIBIO_new_PKCS7()\fR.
.PP
If a signer is specified it will use the default digest for the signing
algorithm. This is \fB\s-1SHA1\s0\fR for both \s-1RSA\s0 and \s-1DSA\s0 keys.
.PP
In OpenSSL 1.0.0 the \fBcerts\fR, \fBsigncert\fR and \fBpkey\fR parameters can all be
\&\fB\s-1NULL\s0\fR if the \fB\s-1PKCS7_PARTIAL\s0\fR flag is set. One or more signers can be added
using the function \fB\f(BIPKCS7_sign_add_signer()\fB\fR. \fB\f(BIPKCS7_final()\fB\fR must also be
called to finalize the structure if streaming is not enabled. Alternative
signing digests can also be specified using this method.
.PP
In OpenSSL 1.0.0 if \fBsigncert\fR and \fBpkey\fR are \s-1NULL\s0 then a certificates only
PKCS#7 structure is output.
.PP
In versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.0 the \fBsigncert\fR and \fBpkey\fR parameters must
\&\fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR be \s-1NULL.\s0

\&\fIPKCS7_sign()\fR returns either a valid \s-1PKCS7\s0 structure or \s-1NULL\s0 if an error
