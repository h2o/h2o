 * 2. repeatedly call quicly_sentmap_allocate to allocate frame-level objects and initialize them
 * 3. call quicly_sentmap_commit
 *
 * The transport iterates (and mutates) the sentmap in the following way:
 * 1. call quicly_sentmap_init_iter
 * 2. call quicly_sentmap_get to obtain the packet header that the iterator points to
 * 3. call quicly_sentmap_update to update the states of the packet that the iterator points to (as well as the state of the frames
 *    that were part of the packet) and move the iterator to the next packet header.  The function is also used for discarding
 * entries from the sent map.
 * 4. call quicly_sentmap_skip to move the iterator to the next packet header
 *
 * Note that quicly_sentmap_update and quicly_sentmap_skip move the iterator to the next packet header.
