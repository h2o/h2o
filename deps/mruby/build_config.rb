# The default build configuration file was moved to `build_config/default.rb`.
#
# Recommended way to customize the build configuration is:
#  * copy `default.rb` (or any config file) to a new file (e.g. `myconfig.rb`)
#  * edit `myconfig.rb`.
#  * `rake MRUBY_CONFIG=/path/to/myconfig.rb` to compile and test.
#  * or `rake MRUBY_CONFIG=myconfig` if your configuration file is in the `build_config` directory.
#  * (optional) submit your configuration as a pull-request if it's useful for others
