## Your Pull Request

To make it easy to review and understand your change please keep the following
things in mind before submitting your pull request:

* Work on the latest possible state of **mruby/master**
* Create a branch which is dedicated to your change
* Test your changes before creating a pull request (`rake test`)
* If possible write a test case which confirms your change
* Don't mix several features or bug-fixes in one pull request
* Create a meaningful commit message
* Explain your change (i.e. with a link to the issue you are fixing)
* Use mrbgem to provide non ISO features (classes, modules and methods) unless
  you have a special reason to implement them in the core

## pre-commit

A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language `pre-commit` hooks.
`pre-commit` can be [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) with `pip`, `curl`, `brew` or `conda`.

You need to first install `pre-commit` and then install the `pre-commit` hooks with `pre-commit install`.
Now `pre-commit` will run automatically on git commit!

It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all the files when adding new hooks (usually `pre-commit` will only run on the changed files during git hooks).
Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to check all files.

To run a single hook use `pre-commit run --all-files <hook_id>`

To update use `pre-commit autoupdate`

Sometimes you might need to skip one or more hooks which can be done with the `SKIP` environment variable.

`$ SKIP=yamllint git commit -m "foo"`

* [Usage](https://pre-commit.com/#usage)
* [pre-commit autoupdate](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-autoupdate)
* [Temporarily disabling hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks)

## Spell Checking

We are running [misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell) which is mainly written in
[Golang](https://golang.org/) to check spelling with [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/lint.yml).
Correct commonly misspelled English words quickly with `misspell`. You can run `misspell` locally
against all files with:

```bash
find . -type f | xargs ./misspell -error
```

Notable `misspell` help options or flags are:

* `-i` string: ignore the following corrections, comma separated
* `-w`: Overwrite file with corrections (default is just to display)

## Coding conventions

How to style your C and Ruby code which you want to submit.

### C code

The core part (parser, bytecode-interpreter, core-lib, etc.) of mruby is
written in the C programming language. Please note the following hints for your
C code:

#### Comply with C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999)

mruby should be highly portable to other systems and compilers. For this it is
recommended to keep your code as close as possible to the C99 standard
(<http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf>).

Visual C++ is also an important target for mruby (supported version is 2013 or
later). For this reason features that are not supported by Visual C++ may not
be used (e.g. `%z` of `strftime()`).

NOTE: Old GCC requires `-std=gnu99` option to enable C99 support.

#### Reduce library dependencies to a minimum

The dependencies to libraries should be kept to an absolute minimum. This
increases the portability but makes it also easier to cut away parts of mruby
on-demand.

#### Insert a break after the function return value:

```c
int
main(void)
{
  ...
}
```

### Ruby code

Parts of the standard library of mruby are written in the Ruby programming
language itself. Please note the following hints for your Ruby code:

#### Comply with the Ruby standard (ISO/IEC 30170:2012)

mruby is currently targeting to execute Ruby code which complies to ISO/IEC
30170:2012 (<https://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579>),
unless there's a clear reason, e.g. the latest Ruby has changed behavior from ISO.
