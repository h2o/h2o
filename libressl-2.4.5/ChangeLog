Because this project is maintained both in the OpenBSD tree using CVS and in
Git, it can be confusing following all of the changes.

Most of the libssl and libcrypto source code is is here in OpenBSD CVS:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/

Some of the libcrypto and OS-compatibility files for entropy and random number
generation are here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libcrypto/

A simplified TLS wrapper library is here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libtls/

The LibreSSL Portable project copies these portions of the OpenBSD tree, along
with relevant portions of the C library, to a Git repository. This makes it
easier to follow all of the relevant changes to the upstream project in a
single place:

	https://github.com/libressl-portable/openbsd

The portable bits of the project are largely maintained out-of-tree, and their
history is also available from Git.

LibreSSL Portable Release Notes:

2.4.5  - Security and compatibility fixes

	* Avoid a side-channel cache-timing attack that can leak the ECDSA
	  private keys when signing. This is due to BN_mod_inverse() being
	  used without the constant time flag being set.

	  This issue was reported by Cesar Pereida Garcia and Billy Brumley
	  (Tampere University of Technology). The fix was developed by Cesar
	  Pereida Garcia.

	* iOS and MacOS compatibility updates from Simone Basso and Jacob
	  Berkman.

2.4.4 - Reliability improvements

	* Avoid continual processing of an unlimited number of TLS records,
	  which can cause a denial-of-service condition.

	* In X509_cmp_time(), pass asn1_time_parse() the tag of the field
	  being parsed so that a malformed GeneralizedTime field is recognized as
	  an error instead of potentially being interpreted as if it was a valid
	  UTCTime.

	* Improve ticket validity checking when tlsext_ticket_key_cb()
	  callback chooses a different HMAC algorithm.

	* Check for packets with a truncated DTLS cookie.

	* Detect zero-length encrypted session data early, instead of when
	  malloc(0) fails or the HMAC check fails.

	* Check for and handle failure of HMAC_{Update,Final} or
	  EVP_DecryptUpdate()

2.4.3 - Bug fixes and reliability improvements

	* Reverted change that cleans up the EVP cipher context in
	  EVP_EncryptFinal() and EVP_DecryptFinal(). Some software relies on the
	  previous behaviour.

	* Avoid unbounded memory growth in libssl, which can be triggered by a
	  TLS client repeatedly renegotiating and sending OCSP Status Request
	  TLS extensions.

	* Avoid falling back to a weak digest for (EC)DH when using SNI with
	  libssl.

2.4.2 - Bug fixes and improvements

	* Fixed loading default certificate locations with openssl s_client.

	* Ensured OSCP only uses and compares GENERALIZEDTIME values as per
	  RFC6960. Also added fixes for OCSP to work with intermediate
	  certificates provided in responses.

	* Improved behavior of arc4random on Windows to not appear to leak
	  memory in debug tools, reduced privileges of allocated memory.

	* Fixed incorrect results from BN_mod_word() when the modulus is too
	  large, thanks to Brian Smith from BoringSSL.

	* Correctly handle an EOF prior to completing the TLS handshake in
	  libtls.

	* Improved libtls ceritificate loading and cipher string validation.

	* Updated libtls cipher group suites into four categories:
	    "secure"   (TLSv1.2+AEAD+PFS)
	    "compat"   (HIGH:!aNULL)
	    "legacy"   (HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL)
	    "insecure" (ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL)
	  This allows for flexibility and finer grained control, rather than
	  having two extremes.

	* Limited support for 'backward compatible' SSLv2 handshake packets to
	  when TLS 1.0 is enabled, providing more restricted compatibility
	  with TLS 1.0 clients.

	* openssl(1) and other documentation improvements.

	* Removed flags for disabling constant-time operations.
	  This removes support for DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME,
	  DH_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME, and RSA_FLAG_NO_CONSTTIME flags, making
	  all of these operations unconditionally constant-time.


2.4.1 - Security fix

	* Correct a problem that prevents the DSA signing algorithm from
	  running in constant time even if the flag BN_FLG_CONSTTIME is set.
	  This issue was reported by Cesar Pereida (Aalto University), Billy
	  Brumley (Tampere University of Technology), and Yuval Yarom (The
	  University of Adelaide and NICTA). The fix was developed by Cesar
	  Pereida.

2.4.0 - Build improvements, new features

	* Many improvements to the CMake build infrastructure, including
	  Solaris, mingw-w64, Cygwin, and HP-UX support. Thanks to Kinichiro
	  Inoguchi for this work.

	* Added missing error handling around bn_wexpand() calls.

	* Added explicit_bzero calls for freed ASN.1 objects.

	* Fixed X509_*set_object functions to return 0 on allocation failure.

	* Implemented the IETF ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suites.

	* Changed default EVP_aead_chacha20_poly1305() implementation to the
	  IETF version, which is now the default.

	* Fixed password prompts from openssl(1) to properly handle ^C.

	* Reworked error handling in libtls so that configuration errors are
	  visible.

	* Deprecated internal use of EVP_[Cipher|Encrypt|Decrypt]_Final.

	* Manpage fixes and updates

2.3.5 - Reliability fix

	* Fixed an error in libcrypto when parsing some ASN.1 elements > 16k.

	* cert.pem has been reorganized and synced with Mozilla's certificate store

2.3.2 - Compatibility and Reliability fixes

	* Changed format of LIBRESSL_VERSION_NUMBER to match that of
	  OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER, see:
	  https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER(3)

	* Added EVP_aead_chacha20_poly1305_ietf() which matches the AEAD
	  construction introduced in RFC 7539, which is different than that
	  already used in TLS with EVP_aead_chacha20_poly1305()

	* Avoid a potential undefined C99+ behavior due to shift overflow in
	  AES_decrypt, reported by Pascal Cuoq <cuoq at trust-in-soft.com>

	* More man pages converted from pod to mdoc format

	* Added COMODO RSA Certification Authority and QuoVadis
	  root certificates to cert.pem

	* Removed Remove "C=US, O=VeriSign, Inc., OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification
	  Authority" (serial 3c:91:31:cb:1f:f6:d0:1b:0e:9a:b8:d0:44:bf:12:be) root
	  certificate from cert.pem

	* Added support for building nc(1) on Solaris

	* Fixed GCC 5.x+ preprocessor checks, reported by Ruslan Babayev

	* Improved console handling with openssl(1) on Windows

	* Ensure the network stack is enabled on Windows when running
	  tls_init()

	* Fixed incorrect TLS certificate loading by nc(1)

	* Added support for Solaris 11.3's getentropy(2) system call

	* Enabled support for using NetBSD 7.0's arc4random(3) implementation

	* Deprecated the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE flag by disabling its effect

	* Fixes from OpenSSL 1.0.1q
	 - CVE-2015-3194 - NULL pointer dereference in client side certificate
	                   validation.
	 - CVE-2015-3195 - Memory leak in PKCS7 - not reachable from TLS/SSL

	* The following OpenSSL CVEs did not apply to LibreSSL
	 - CVE-2015-3193 - Carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery
	                   squaring procedure.
	 - CVE-2015-3196 - Double free race condition of the identify hint
	                   data.

	 See https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-announce&m=144925068504102

2.3.1 - ASN.1 and time handling cleanups

	* ASN.1 cleanups and RFC5280 compliance fixes.

	* Time representations switched from 'unsigned long' to 'time_t'. LibreSSL
	  now checks if the host OS supports 64-bit time_t.

	* Fixed a leak in SSL_new in the error path.

	* Support always extracting the peer cipher and version with libtls.

	* Added ability to check certificate validity times with libtls,
	  tls_peer_cert_notbefore and tls_peer_cert_notafter.

	* Changed tls_connect_servername to use the first address that resolves with
	  getaddrinfo().

	* Remove broken conditional EVP_CHECK_DES_KEY code (non-functional since
	  initial commit in 2004).

	* Fixed a memory leak and out-of-bounds access in OBJ_obj2txt, reported
	  by Qualys Security.

	* Fixed an up-to 7 byte overflow in RC4 when len is not a multiple of
	  sizeof(RC4_CHUNK), reported by Pascal Cuoq <cuoq at trust-in-soft.com>.

	* Reject too small bits value in BN_generate_prime_ex(), so that it does
	  not risk becoming negative in probable_prime_dh_safe(), reported by
		Franck Denis.

	* Enable nc(1) builds on more platforms.

2.3.0 - SSLv3 removed, libtls API changes, portability improvements

	* SSLv3 is now permanently removed from the tree.

	* The libtls API is changed from the 2.2.x series.

	  The read/write functions work correctly with external event
	  libraries.  See the tls_init man page for examples of using libtls
	  correctly in asynchronous mode.

	  Client-side verification is now supported, with the client supplying
	  the certificate to the server.

	  Also, when using tls_connect_fds, tls_connect_socket or
	  tls_accept_fds, libtls no longer implicitly closes the passed in
	  sockets. The caller is responsible for closing them in this case.

	* When loading a DSA key from an raw (without DH parameters) ASN.1
	  serialization, perform some consistency checks on its `p' and `q'
	  values, and return an error if the checks failed.

	  Thanks for Georgi Guninski (guninski at guninski dot com) for
	  mentioning the possibility of a weak (non prime) q value and
	  providing a test case.

	  See
	  https://cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2015-September/009007.html
	  for a longer discussion.

	* Fixed a bug in ECDH_compute_key that can lead to silent truncation
	  of the result key without error. A coding error could cause software
	  to use much shorter keys than intended.

	* Removed support for DTLS_BAD_VER. Pre-DTLSv1 implementations are no
	  longer supported.

	* The engine command and parameters are removed from the openssl(1).
	  Previous releases removed dynamic and builtin engine support
	  already.

	* SHA-0 is removed, which was withdrawn shortly after publication 20
	  years ago.

	* Added Certplus CA root certificate to the default cert.pem file.

	* New interface OPENSSL_cpu_caps is provided that does not allow
	  software to inadvertently modify cpu capability flags.
	  OPENSSL_ia32cap and OPENSSL_ia32cap_loc are removed.

	* The out_len argument of AEAD changed from ssize_t to size_t.

	* Deduplicated DTLS code, sharing bugfixes and improvements with
	  TLS.

	* Converted 'nc' to use libtls for client and server operations; it is
	  included in the libressl-portable distribution as an example of how
	  to use the library.

2.2.3 - Bug fixes, build enhancements

	* LibreSSL 2.2.2 incorrectly handles ClientHello messages that do not
	  include TLS extensions, resulting in such handshakes being aborted.
	  This release corrects the handling of such messages. Thanks to
	  Ligushka from github for reporting the issue.

	* Added install target for cmake builds. Thanks to TheNietsnie from
	  github.

	* Updated pkgconfig files to correctly report the release version
	  number, not the individual library ABI version numbers. Thanks to
	  Jan Engelhardt for reporting the issue.

2.2.2 - More TLS parser rework, bug fixes, expanded portable build support

	* Switched 'openssl dhparam' default from 512 to 2048 bits

	* Reworked openssl(1) option handling

	* More CRYPTO ByteString (CBC) packet parsing conversions

	* Fixed 'openssl pkeyutl -verify' to exit with a 0 on success

	* Fixed dozens of Coverity issues including dead code, memory leaks,
	  logic errors and more.

	* Ensure that openssl(1) restores terminal echo state after reading a
	  password.

	* Incorporated fix for OpenSSL Issue #3683

	* LibreSSL version define LIBRESSL_VERSION_NUMBER will now be bumped
	  for each portable release.

	* Removed workarounds for TLS client padding bugs.

	* No longer disable ECDHE-ECDSA on OS X

	* Removed SSLv3 support from openssl(1)

	* Removed IE 6 SSLv3 workarounds.

	* Modified tls_write in libtls to allow partial writes, clarified with
	  examples in the documentation.

	* Removed RSAX engine

	* Tested SSLv3 removal with the OpenBSD ports tree and found several
	  applications that were not ready to build without SSLv3 yet. For
	  now, building a program that intentionally uses SSLv3 will result in
	  a linker warning.

	* Added TLS_method, TLS_client_method and TLS_server_method as a
	  replacement for the SSLv23_*method calls.

	* Added initial cmake build support, including support for building with
	  Visual Studio, currently tested with Visual Studio 2013 Community
	  Edition.

	* --with-enginesdir is removed as a configuration parameter

	* Default cert.pem, openssl.cnf, and x509v3.cnf files are now
	  installed under $sysconfdir/ssl or the directory specified by
	  --with-openssldir. Previous versions of LibreSSL left these empty.

2.2.1 - Build fixes, feature added, features removed

	* Assorted build fixes for musl, HP-UX, Mingw, Solaris.

	* Removed unused and obsolete MDC-2DES cipher

	* Removed workarounds for obsolete SSL implementations

2.2.0 - Build cleanups and new OS support, Security Updates

	* AIX Support - thanks to Michael Felt

	* Cygwin Support - thanks to Corinna Vinschen

	* Refactored build macros, support packaging libtls independently.
	  There are more pieces required to support building and using OpenSSL
	  with libtls, but this is an initial start at providing an
	  independent package for people to start hacking on.

	* Removal of OPENSSL_issetugid and all library getenv calls.
	  Applications can and should no longer rely on environment variables
	  for changing library behavior. OPENSSL_CONF/SSLEAY_CONF is still
	  supported with the openssl(1) command.

	* libtls API and documentation additions

	* Various bug fixes and simplifications to libssl and libcrypto

	* Fixes for the following issues are integrated into LibreSSL 2.2.0:

	  - CVE-2015-0288 - X509_to_X509_REQ NULL pointer deref
	  - CVE-2015-0289 - PKCS7 NULL pointer dereferences

	* The fix for CVE-2015-0207 - Segmentation fault in DTLSv1_listen
	  is integrated for safety, but LibreSSL is not vulnerable.

	* Libtls is now built by default. The --enable-libtls
	  configuration option is no longer required.
	  The libtls API is now stable for the 2.1.x series.

2.1.5 - Bug fixes and a security update
	* Fix incorrect comparison function in openssl(1) certhash command.
	  Thanks to Christian Neukirchen / Void Linux.

	    without direct access to CA certificate files.

	  - Ciphers default to TLSv1.2 with AEAD and PFS.

	  - Improved error handling and message generation

	  - New APIs and improved documentation

	* Added X509_STORE_load_mem API for loading certificates from memory.
	  This facilitates accessing certificates from a chrooted environment.

	* New AEAD "MAC alias" allows configuring TLSv1.2 AEAD ciphers by
	  using 'TLSv1.2+AEAD' as the cipher selection string.

	* Dead and disabled code removal including MD5, Netscape workarounds,
	  non-POSIX IO, SCTP, RFC 3779 support, many #if 0 sections, and more.

	* ASN1 macro maze expanded to aid reading and searching the code.

	* NULL pointer asserts removed in favor of letting the OS/signal
	  handler catch them.

	* Server-side support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV for compatibility with
	  various auditor and vulnerability scanners.

	* Dozens of issues found with the Coverity scanner fixed.

	* Security Updates:

	  - Fix a minor information leak that was introduced in t1_lib.c
	    r1.71, whereby an additional 28 bytes of .rodata (or .data) is
	    provided to the network. In most cases this is a non-issue since
	    the memory content is already public. Issue found and reported by
	    Felix Groebert of the Google Security Team.

	  - Fixes for the following low-severity issues were integrated into
	    LibreSSL from OpenSSL 1.0.1k:

	     Reported by Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA.

	    The following CVEs were fixed in earlier LibreSSL releases:
	     CVE-2015-0206 - Memory leak handling repeated DLTS records
	     CVE-2014-3510 - Flaw handling DTLS anonymous EC(DH) ciphersuites.

	    The following CVEs did not apply to LibreSSL:
	     CVE-2014-3571 - DTLS segmentation fault in dtls1_get_record

	  Thanks to Anthony G. Bastile.

	* Enable extra compiler hardening flags by default, where applicable.
	  The default set of hardening features can vary by OS to OS, so
	  feedback is welcome on this. To disable the default hardening flags,
	  specify '--disable-hardening' during configure.
	  Thanks to Jim Barlow

	* Initial HP-UX support, tested with HP-UX 11.31 ia64
