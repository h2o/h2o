# Thing to Do in the future

# After mruby 3.1

* multi-precision integer
* parser and code generator independent from `mrb_state` (picoruby?)
* variable sized AST node
* iv/hash entry cache
* more peephole optimization (if possible)

# Things to do (Things we need to consider)

* `begin ... end while cond` to behave as CRuby
* special variables ($1,$2..)
